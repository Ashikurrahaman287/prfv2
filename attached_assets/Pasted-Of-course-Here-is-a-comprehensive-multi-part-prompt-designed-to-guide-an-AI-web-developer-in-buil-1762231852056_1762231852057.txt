## **Core Mandates & Aesthetics**

  * **Theme:** Implement a **sleek, modern dark theme**. Use a color palette of deep charcoal or navy blue as the base, with accents of electric blue, cool white, and perhaps a subtle gold for highlighting key achievements or titles.
  * **Typography:** Use a clean, sans-serif font like 'Inter', 'Poppins', or 'Source Code Pro' that is both futuristic and highly readable.
  * **Animations:** This is crucial. The site must feature **sophisticated, blockchain-themed animations**. These should be elegant, not distracting.
      * **Background Animation:** A subtle, slow-moving animation of interconnected nodes and data streams, like a neural network or a blockchain ledger, should be present in the background of the Hero section.
      * **On-Scroll Animations:** Animate elements into view as the user scrolls (e.g., fade-ins, slide-ins). The professional experience timeline should build itself as the user scrolls down.
      * **Hover Effects:** Interactive hover effects on buttons, skill cards, and project links. For example, a card could emit a subtle glow or flip to show more details.
  * **Layout:** A clean, professional, and intuitive single-page layout with a sticky navigation bar that allows users to jump to different sections (e.g., About, Experience, Skills, Ventures, Contact).
  * **Responsiveness:** The website must be fully responsive and flawlessly functional on all devices, from large desktops to mobile phones.
