Overall Animation Philosophy
The animations should be subtle, elegant, and purposeful, enhancing the user experience without distracting from the content. They should embody the concepts of decentralization, connectivity, security, and data flow inherent in blockchain technology. The overall feeling should be one of advanced technology, precision, and forward-thinking innovation.

Global & Thematic Animations (Applied Across the Site)
Background Blockchain Network (Hero & Key Sections):

Description: A dynamic, low-opacity, deep background animation of a constantly evolving blockchain network. This should be present in the Hero section and subtly extend or reappear in other major sections (e.g., Leadership & Ventures, Professional Journey).

Visuals: Interconnected nodes (small, glowing geometric shapes like hexagons or cubes) linked by thin, glowing lines representing data flow. These lines should occasionally pulse or show subtle, fast-moving "data packets."

Movement: Slow, fluid, organic movement. Nodes should slightly drift, and lines should subtly shift and reconnect, illustrating a constantly active but stable network. Avoid rapid, jarring movements.

Color Scheme: Use the electric blue and cool white accents for the glows, against the deep charcoal/navy background. The lines connecting nodes could be a very light, almost transparent electric blue.

Interactivity (Subtle): Perhaps a very faint ripple effect when the mouse hovers over certain areas, as if disturbing the data flow.

"Chain" Link Transitions / Dividers:

Description: Instead of plain horizontal rules, use stylized, animated "chain" links or a data stream effect as section dividers or loading indicators.

Visuals: A series of interconnected, glowing geometric shapes (like abstract blockchain blocks) that briefly animate when a new section loads or scrolls into view. Alternatively, a horizontal line that "builds" itself from the center outwards with a digital-glitch or data-stream effect.

Color Scheme: Predominantly electric blue and white.

Digital Glitch / Data Stream Effects (Hover & Focus):

Description: Apply a subtle, fast, digital glitch or data stream effect to interactive elements upon hover or focus.

Application: Buttons, navigation links, interactive cards (e.g., venture cards, skill cards).

Visuals: A brief, almost imperceptible flicker or distortion of text/icons, as if data is rapidly refreshing or encrypting/decrypting. This should last only a fraction of a second.

Section-Specific Animations
1. Hero Section Enhancements:
CTA Button Glow: On hover, the "View My Work" and "Get In Touch" buttons should emit a soft, electric blue glow that expands slightly from the button's edges.

Key Stats Counters: The numerical values (10+, $115M+, 20M+) should animate upwards from zero when they come into view, quickly counting to their final value with a digital, segmented display aesthetic.

Subtle Particle Emitters: Very faint, small, glowing particles (like tiny data bits) could emanate slowly upwards from the bottom of the Hero section, dissipating as they rise.

2. About Me Section:
Text Reveal: The "About Me" text should gracefully fade in or type out character by character, perhaps with a subtle "console log" effect, as the user scrolls to this section.

3. Skills & Expertise Section:
Skill Card Entry Animation: Each skill card (for Core Skills and Technical Skills) should slide in from different directions (e.g., left and right for respective columns) or zoom in from slightly opaque to fully visible, with a very slight delay between each card to create a staggered effect when the section loads.

Skill Card Hover Effect: On hover, a skill card should subtly lift (slight 3D transform) and the text within it should emit a faint, internal electric blue glow.

4. Leadership & Ventures Section:
Venture Card Reveal: Each "Venture" card (SpudPay, SpudBlocks, AGT Venture, AscendEX) should appear with a "blockchain block" reveal animation. Imagine a block forming and sliding into place, or appearing with a swift, geometric wipe.

Logo Animation: When a venture card comes into view, its associated company logo could have a brief, subtle "digital scan" or "circuit trace" animation applied to it.

Information Expansion: On click/tap, the card could expand downwards slightly to reveal more detailed information about the venture, with a smooth transition.

5. Professional Experience Section (Timeline Focus):
Timeline Build-Up: This is a key area for animation. As the user scrolls down, the timeline should visually construct itself.

Connecting Lines: The vertical connecting lines of the timeline should draw themselves downwards as the user scrolls to each new entry.

Entry Block Reveal: Each professional experience entry block (Copx.AI, Tapbit.com, etc.) should slide in horizontally (e.g., alternating from left/right) and then "snap" into place along the drawn timeline, with a slight bounce effect.

Achievement List Animation: Once an experience block is in place, its bulleted achievements should fade or slide in sequentially, one after another, after a short delay.

6. Trusted By Section:
Infinite Scrolling Carousel: The client logos should smoothly and continuously scroll horizontally across the screen from right to left (or vice-versa), with a slight pause on hover.

Logo Highlight: On hover, each individual logo could have a brief, subtle glow or a border animation that mimics a data packet traveling around its edges.

7. Awards & Recognition Section:
Award Card Entry: Each award card should zoom in from a slightly smaller scale or perform a subtle 3D flip as the section becomes visible.

Icon Animation: The trophy or other icons within the award cards should have a brief, subtle sparkle or pulse effect when they appear.

8. Contact Section:
Form Field Focus: When a user clicks on a contact form field, the border of the input field should briefly glow electric blue.

Social Icon Hover: Social media icons (LinkedIn) should have a gentle "pulse" or a color inversion effect on hover.

Technical Considerations
Performance: All animations must be highly optimized for smooth performance across various devices and network speeds. Prioritize CSS animations and transitions where possible, falling back to JavaScript (e.g., GSAP, Framer Motion) for more complex sequences.

Accessibility: Ensure animations do not cause motion sickness or discomfort. Provide an option (even if hidden) to disable animations if necessary for accessibility.

Browser Compatibility: Test thoroughly across modern browsers.
